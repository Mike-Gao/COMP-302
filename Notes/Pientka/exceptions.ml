OCaml as any other flavor of the ML-language family is a safe language. 
This is ensured by static type checking and by
dynamic checks that rule out violations that cannot be detected
 statically. 

Examples: division by zero, arithmetic overflow

Static violations are signalled by type checking error.
Dynamic violations are signalled by raising an exception.

For example: 

3 / 0 will type-check but cannot be evaluated and will incur a
 runtime fault that is signalled by raising the exception Division_by_zero

An exception is a form of answer to the query: what is the value of
 this expression?

OCaml will report this error as follows:

# 3 / 0;;
Exception: Division_by_zero.
# 

Another source of dynamic run-time error is due to non-exhaustive
 matches. For example:

let head (x::t) = x ;;
Characters 9-19:
  let head (x::t) = x ;;
           ^^^^^^^^^^
Warning P: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
[]
val head : 'a list -> 'a = <fun>
# head [];;
Exception: Match_failure ("", 650, -489).
#  

A related situation arises when you pattern match against a specific
pattern in a let or case construct.

# let test l = let h:: _ = l in h;;
Characters 17-22:
  let test l = let h:: _ = l in h;;
                   ^^^^^
Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
[]
val test : 'a list -> 'a = <fun>
# test [];;
Exception: Match_failure ("//toplevel//", 286, -7548).

So far we have considered examples of pre-defined exceptions.Since
built-in exceptions have a built-in meaning, we can in fact introduce
new excpetions to signal program specific errors.

(* -----------------------------------------------------------------*)
(* We have briefly seen the use of user-defined exceptions already...
   Here is the example we have seen earlier *)

exception Domain

(*
   Check the invariant for the externally
   visible function only, and not during recursion.
*)

let fact n =
  let rec f n = 
    if n = 0 then 1
    else n * f (n-1)  
  in
  if n < 0 then raise Domain
  else f n

(* Define a wrapper for `fact` that catches the error and nicely prints it. *)
let runFact n =
  try
    let r = fact n in 
    print_string ("Factorial of " ^  string_of_int n ^ " is " ^ string_of_int r ^ "\n")
  with
  | Domain ->
      print_string "Error: Invariant violated -- trying to call factorial on inputs < 0"

(*
# runFact ();;
Calculate factorial of: 3
Factorial of 3 is 6
- : unit = ()

# runFact (-3);;
Error: Invariant violated -- trying to call factorial on inputs < 0 
- : unit = ()
# 
*)

(* -----------------------------------------------------------------*)

type key = int
type 'a btree = 
  | Empty 
  | Node of 'a btree * (key * 'a) * 'a btree

(* Previous solution to checking whether there is an element with key
   k in the tree provided based on option type; 

   findOpt : 'a btree -> int -> 'a opt *)
let rec findOpt t k = match t with 
  | Empty -> None
  | Node(l, (k', _), _) when k < k' -> findOpt l k
  | Node(_, (k', _), r) when k > k' -> findOpt r k
  | Node(_, (_ , x), _) -> Some x

(* Using exceptions to signal error *)
(* New implementation using exception *)

(* Define a program-specific exception with a name *)
exception NoSuchKey of key (* exception includes the problematic key *)

(* Technically, an `exception` declaration is _adding a new
   constructor_ to the preexisting type `exn`.
   When we define such new exception, we can also bundle other data,
   similar to ordinary constructors.
   Then, the try-with construct allows us to catch raised exceptions
   and perform _pattern-matching_ on the `exn` type.
*)

(* Find (T,k) = d if (k,d) is in the tree T
   raises exception NoSuchKey otherwise *)
let rec find t k = match t with 
  | Empty -> raise (NoSuchKey k) (* raise instead of using None *)
  | Node (l, (k', d), r) when k < k' -> find l k
  | Node (_, (k', _), r) when k > k' -> find r k
  | Node (_, (_,  x), _) -> x (* no need to use Some now *)

(* Find t k n = d 
   searches the tree T up to depth n. If we did no find an entry with key k
   we raise the exception Error with error msg "No entry found in tree"; 
   if we exceeded our bound n, we raise the exception Error with the
   error msg "Bound exceeded" .
*)

exception ErrorMsg of string

let rec findEx t k n = 
  match t with
  | _ when n < 0 -> raise (ErrorMsg "Bound exceeded")
  | Empty ->
      raise (ErrorMsg ("No entry with key " ^ 
                       string_of_int k ^ 
			                    " found in tree"))
  | Node (l, (k', _), _) when k < k' -> findEx l k (n - 1)
  | Node (_, (k', _), r) when k > k' -> findEx r k (n - 1)
  | Node (_, (_,  x), _) -> x

(* Instead of using strings, we can define separate exceptions.
   This makes it possible for the caller to easily determine which
   error occurred by using try-with.
*)

exception BoundExceeded
(* We already defined NoSuchKey *)

let rec findEx' t k n = 
  match t with
  | _ when n < 0 -> raise BoundExceeded
  | Empty -> raise (NoSuchKey k)
  | Node (l, (k', _), _) when k < k' -> findEx' l k (n - 1)
  | Node (_, (k', _), r) when k > k' -> findEx' r k (n - 1)
  | Node (_, (_,  x), _) -> x

(***** _Structured_ errors *****
 Idea:
  1. define a datatype to represent a collection of app-specific errors
  2. define a single exception that bundles a value of that type.
  
  Now it is easy to handle every app-specific error that a particular
  function could raise, if we document it to say "it could raise
  LookupError".
*)

type lookup_error =
  | BoundExceeded
  | NoSuchKey of key

exception LookupError of lookup_error 

(* Define a helper for raising lookup errors. *)
let lookup_error e = raise (LookupError e)

let rec findEx'' t k n = 
  match t with
  | _ when n < 0 -> lookup_error BoundExceeded
  | Empty -> lookup_error (NoSuchKey k)
  | Node (l, (k', _), _) when k < k' -> findEx' l k (n - 1)
  | Node (_, (k', _), r) when k > k' -> findEx' r k (n - 1)
  | Node (_, (_,  x), _) -> x


(* -----------------------------------------------------------------*)

(* Some top level functions which illustrate how to
 handle exceptions; we contrast it to how to handle
 optional value *)

let findOpt_top t k = 
  match findOpt t k with
  | None   -> print_string ("Found no element with key " ^ string_of_int k ^ " in tree \n")
  | Some d -> print_string ("Found element " ^ string_of_int d ^ " in tree \n")

(* -----------------------------------------------------------------*)
(* HANDLING OF EXCEPTIONS 
 
   try exp1 with exc_pat -> exp 2

   installs an exception handler.

   This allows for non-local transfer of control. We may catch a
   raised exception and continue evaluating along some other path.

   OCaml attempts to evaluate the expression exp1. If this yields a value, then this
   value is returned. If evaluation of part of expression exp1 raises an exception exc
   then evalution of exp1 will stop possibly midway and exc is matched against exc_pat
   to determine how to proceed.  

   if there is no handler or no successful match, the exception
   will re-raised and propagated to the next higher level.

   If it is never caught at any higher level, the computation will
   abort with an uncaugt exception exc

*)

let find_top t k = 
  try
    let d = find t k in  
    (* the exception raised by find(T,k) will propel you 
	     to the next higher level! -- nothing below this line
	     in particular the statement print "Found element ..."
	     will not be executed *)
    print_string ("Found element " ^ string_of_int d ^ " in tree \n")
  with NoSuchKey k ->
    print_string ("Found no element with key " ^ string_of_int k ^ " in tree \n")


(* we can pattern match on exceptions under `with`. *)
let find_toplevel t k = 
  try
    findEx t k 4
  with 
  | ErrorMsg msg ->  print_string msg

(* we can also dispatch on the different exceptions *)
let find_top' fmt t k = 
  (* exercise: what is the type of fmt? *)
  try
    let x = findEx' t k 4 in
    print_string ("Found element: " ^ fmt x)
  with 
  | BoundExceeded ->  print_string ("Bound exceeded  \n")
  | NoSuchKey k ->  print_string ("Found no element with key " ^ string_of_int k ^ " in tree \n")
     
(* -----------------------------------------------------------------*)
(* Exceptions are propogated to the next level, if they are not caught! *)
let find_uncaught t k = find t k

let find_catch t k = 
  try 
    let d = find_uncaught t k in 
    print_string ("Found element " ^ string_of_int d ^ " in tree \n")
  with
  | NoSuchKey k -> print_string ("Found no element with key " ^ string_of_int k ^ " in tree \n")

(* We can define an exception-safe wrapper for findEx'' leveraging
   higher-order functions to handle only the app-specific errors. *)
let safe_findEx'' handler t k n  =
  (* Install an exception handler for LookupError using the try-with syntax.
     More on this below.
  *)
  try findEx'' t k n with
  | LookupError e -> handler e
(* any other exception will simply be reraised *)

(* e.g. handled_findEx'' performs the search, and handles only the
  app-specific errors by nicely printing them and cleanly exiting the
  program.
*)
let handled_findEx'' t k n =
  safe_findEx''
    (function
      | BoundExceeded ->
          print_string ("Search bound " ^ string_of_int n ^ " exceeded");
          exit 1
      | NoSuchKey k ->
          print_string ("Key " ^ string_of_int k ^ " not found.");
          exit 1)
    t k n

(* Structured errors give an excellent way to separate the concerns of the program:
   1. the searching is unobscured by exception handling logic
   2. the handler logic is parameterized via a higher-order function,
      so different handling logic can be plugged in as needed.
   3. by partially applying the handler function, we recover a safe
      lookup function that performs the already specified error-recovery
      logic.
*)

(* The primary benefit of exceptions:
   Separating the happy path (e.g. tree searching) from error
   handling.
*)

(* This use of exceptions to signal error conditions sugests raising
   exceptions is fatal: an unhandled exception terminates the program
   -- but signalling an error is only one use of exceptions! 
   We can instead use exceptions to construct interesting types of
   control flow.

(* USING EXCEPTIONS FOR BACKTRACKING - Diverting the control flow                    *)
(* Use of exceptions to initiate backtracking in a tree
   which is not necessarily a binary search tree *)

      try
        find_gen l k
      with
      | NotFound ->
          find_gen r k

(* Exercise: reimplement `find_gen` to use option instead of
   exceptions for errors. *)
