Floating-point representations have a base (which is always assumed to be even)
   and a precision p. If b = 10 and p = 3, then the number 0.1 is represented as
   1.00 × 10^-1. If b = 2 and p = 24, then the decimal number 0.1 cannot be
   represented exactly, but is approximately 1.10011001100110011001101 × 2^-4.
